This Android App is meant for long car rides where you cannot find an FM station that fits your liking/current mood/style and you are sick of your iPod and you aren't equipped with Satellite radio and you don't have any more CDs and...

Simply type a query relating to an artist/song that best fits your tastes, find it in the list of possible matches, and the app will use your current location to determine FM stations that are in a 60 mile radius of your phone.

This app was written using api.yes.com radio listings, and the Jackson JSON parser.
